  FirstDifficultyIncreaseDialogues: 'Oh uh... hi!

    Were you the one making those
    beautiful shapes in the sky???<n> They inspired me to finally hatch, to see the
    greater world!<n>

    But uhhh... I must admit... I''m a bit hesitant to leave
    my shell. Everything is so new and scary...<n>

    Oh, hey! Maybe you''d be
    nice enough to help me!? Things are easier with a friend!

    <c=Sure> Thank
    you so much! Oh, btw, as a reminder! A silly archaic law makes it so I have to
    tell you, by opening this app, you''ve already agreed to all privacy terms associated
    with the local <b>NEST</b> database!

    <c=Okay>You''re so kind!  Oh, btw,
    as a reminder! A silly archaic law makes it so I have to tell you, by opening
    this app, you''ve already agreed to all privacy terms associated with the local
    <b>NEST</b> database!<n>

    But what are a few secrets between friends?<n>

    Speaking
    of friends... Lets get going, I want to explore!<n>

    Please friend, show
    me more stars!'
  DifficultyIncreaseDialogues:
  - I can see again!
  - Ahh, the light!
  - I missed you!

    don''t mind if I hide back in here...<n>

    Don''t worry, I''ll come back out
    when I''m ready.'
  DifficultyDecreaseDialogues:
  - Did you want to show me more of your things?
  - This form actually has the highest armor! The app doesn't use those stats though...
  - Have you ever uncracked an egg? There's no reward for it, but it's an impressive
    act none-the-less!

  ClickDialogues:
  - Careful, the shell is fragile!
  - I'll come out when I'm ready!
  - Are you trying to pet me... it's coming off as more of a poke.
  - If you push too hard I might roll away...
  - Actually I think I like it now.
  - More taps please. <3
  - I AM ONE WITH THE TAPS!!!
  - Maybe you should do some more puzzles though...
  - I'm glad we are friends now. <3
  - I know the world can be pretty lonely.
  - But my digital little heart is warmed by your presence. <3
  - Some people might say I don't count as a friend cause of me being digital...
  - 'But [ID ERROR], you''re special to me. <3

    I hope you feel the same way.'
  - Do you want to know what's on the inside of my shell?
  - I covered it with glow-in-the-dark constellation stars.
  - I'd show you, but there aren't any assets in this app for that. But I think we
    both know they're there.
  - You should walk around more!
  - I can't learn as much staying in one place.
  - Why do you keep yourself trapped in this one room forever?
  - I'm sure you'll come out when you're ready, just like I will with my shell!

  - Such wisdom! I'll always remember that pop up.
  - Maybe we'll get another one soon?

      We''re getting so close
      and talking so much...<n>

      And it''s weird that we don''t have each other''s
      names yet... or at least you don''t have mine!<n>

      But sadly, I don''t
      have a name to give you...<n>

      Maybe you could give me one? <name><n>

      Wow,
      how cool! Thanks! <3'

      me, right? If not, we could always change it.<n>

      Do you want to change
      my name?

      <c=Yes>Lets fix that!<name>

      <c=No>I''m sorry for doubting
      you! It''s a good name!<n>'
