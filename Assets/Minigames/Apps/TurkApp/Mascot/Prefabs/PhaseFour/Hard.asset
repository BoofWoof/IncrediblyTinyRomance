    Just- JUST WOW<n>

    LOOK
    AT ME!<n>

    I can fly, my feathers are all the way in, AND I CAN SEE THE
    STARS LIKE NEVER BEFORE!<n>

    You''ve helped me come so far...<n>

    But
    like all birds, that means I''ll have to leave soon...<n>

    Are you ready
    for that?

    <c=No>I feel the same way...

    <c=PLZ STAY>I can''t. ;-;<n>

    But...<n>

    Well,
    the bandwidth around here is pretty bad... maybe I can stay for a few more puzzles..<n>

    Think
    we can do one more set together?<n>

    Lets remember those close to us this
    time time, alright?<n>

    What, you don''t have any friends?<n>

    You
    just arrived here you say?<n>

    Well then we''ll go with the people literally
    near to you!<n>

    All the people you might want to take with you if you started
    to fly too. <3<n>

    [PLEASE GIVE THE APP FIVE STARS AND RECOMMEND IT TO A
    FRIEND!]'

  - I'm flying so high!
  - I can almost touch the stars!
  - Can't catch me now. >:3
  - -STOP ADDING RESPONSE PHRASES TO THAT STUPID BIRD, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THOSE
    BEAKLESS SLOBS. JUST SHIP IT SO WE CAN BE DONE WITH THIS STU-
  - Tee Hee, I'm zooming!

  - I've become so strong since I met you!
  - I could never imagine flying with such ease!
  - I guess what I'm saying is that... sometimes our imaginations are too limited.
  - We see where we are now, and we see our current trajectory through life, and
    we begin to imagine that could never change.
  - And yet... there is so much beyond those mental walls... as long as you can fly
    over them.
  - Don't get me wrong. A new route through life will take so much more work to achieve
    than going with the flow.
  - But sometimes- no- always, the best things in life take a lot of work. Just look
    how far the two of us have come with a bit of wing grease!
  - I hope that the next time you see an oppertunity, that you're ready to grab it,
    no matter how hard you have to work to do so.
  - There are opportunity in the stars... and far beyond.
  - We got this. <3

  - You must have that one memorized already.
  - The secrets contained in such scrolls... amazing.
  - You must be a speed reader as fast as you got through that one.
  - Please take such messages more seriously!

      That''s

      It''s like there''s not a big enough population here to
      need last names!<n>

      But that couldn''t happen... hahaha...'

      And yet none are found

      How crazy is that!<n>

      One
      person is rare... but more than twenty and counting!?<n>

      Thank you so
      much for helping me find more people lost and without family!<n>

      Maybe
      recommend this app to them! My siblings could give them some friends as well.
      <3<n>

      We should always be looking to help others.'
