    I need to do the same!<n>

    I''m out of my
    shell and I''m doing just fine!<n>

    Do I look how you expected?

    <c=Yes>
    You''re so intuitive!

    <c=No> Is it the telescope? No matter, a bird has
    to have hobbies!<n>

    Speaking of, I think I''ve learned everything I need
    to about objects, for now. I want to start learning about concepts.<n>

    But
    to make things interesting, maybe I''ll share a few concepts of my own.<n>

    Doesn''t
    that sound fun?'
  DifficultyIncreaseDialogues:
  - I'm back and better than ever!~
  - I can finally take my telescope back out of storage.
  - I'm brave, I promise!
  - Lets get back to concepts!

  - You're wondering where this telescope came from?
  - It was in my egg too. :>
  - There's a lot of things in there.
  - You're not allowed to see, though.
  - You think I'm a hypocrite for not showing you?
  - But it's in your best interest for me to not show you!
  - Your mind would be blown by my egg's contents, you're not ready!
  - I only keep secrets for your own good, you only keep secrets cause you want to
    make bird sad. :c
  - I hope that makes sense!
  - <3
  - It's okay, I don't blame you for asking.
  - Wanna solve some more puzzles?

  - I'm glad that <color=blue>Flock</color> is nice enough to gift us such wise messages.
  - We should look into that message, it seemed to be offering great wisdom!

      Do you ever feel lonely?<n>

      <c=Yes>Me
      too.

      <c=No>Oh... I guess I''m alone on this...<n>

      Don''t get
      me wrong, we have each other, and that is nice.<n>

      But a community
      can mean so much more than friendship.<n>

      A community can not just
      provide bonding, but accountability and a drive to become better.<n>

      You
      might not need it now, but we all hit a ceiling eventually.<n>

      Think
      on it.'
