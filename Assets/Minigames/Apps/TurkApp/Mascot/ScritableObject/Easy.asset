  FirstDifficultyIncreaseDialogues: 'Oh uh... hi!

    You seem to have hatched me...
    Thanks!!!<n>

    I uh... I''m not completely sure what''s going on right now.
    Brains a bit empty having just hatched...<n>

    Maybe you''d be nice enough
    to help teach me!?

    <c=Sure> Thank you so much! And as a reminder that a
    silly archaic law forces me to make, by opening this app, you have already agreed
    to all data storage terms of the locall <b>NEST</b> database.

    <c=Okay>You''re
    so kind!  And as a reminder that a silly archaic law forces me to make, by opening
    this app, you have already agreed to all data storage terms of the locall <b>NEST</b>
    database.'
  DifficultyIncreaseDialogues:
  - I can see again!
  - Ahh, the light!
  - I missed you!

  FirstDifficultyDecreaseDialogues: I'm actually feeling a bit shy. I hope you don't
    mind if I hide back in here...
  DifficultyDecreaseDialogues:
  - Did you want to show me more of your things?
  - This form actually has the highest armor! The app doesn't use those stats though...
  - Have you ever uncracked an egg? There's no reward for it, but it's an impressive
    act none-the-less!
  ClickDialogues:
  - Careful, the shell is fragile!
  - I'll come out when I'm ready!
  - Are you trying to pet me... it's coming off as more of a poke.
  - If you push too hard I might roll away...
  - Actually I think I like it now.
  - More taps please. <3
  - I AM ONE WITH THE TAPS!!!
  - Maybe you should do some more puzzles though...
  - I'm glad we are friends now. <3
  - I know the world can be pretty lonely.
  - But my digital little heart is warmed by your presence. <3
  - Some people might say I don't count as a friend cause of me being digital...
  - 'But [ID ERROR], you''re special to me. <3

    I hope you feel the same way.'
  - Do you want to know what's on the inside of my shell?
  - I covered it with glow-in-the-dark constellation stars.
  - I'd show you, but there aren't any assets in this app for that. But I think we
    both know they're there.
  - You should walk around more!
  - I can't learn as much staying in one place.
  - Why do you keep yourself trapped in this one room forever?
  - I'm sure you'll come out when you're ready, just like I will with my shell!
