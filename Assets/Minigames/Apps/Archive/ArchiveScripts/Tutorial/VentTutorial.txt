For proper purifier operations, insure that every vent intake leads to at least one purification station while avoiding any leaks along the way.

<b>Color Codes:</b>
<color=grey>Grey Light</color>: If a vent is unused with no fumes flowing through it, the vent will show a grey signal. This is permitted in the final vent formation.
<color=black>Vent</color=black> <color=red>Red Light</color>: If a vent shows the red signal, it is receiving fumes from an intake, but it is also leaking those fumes for the building's inhabitants to inhale. This is not allowed in the final vent formation.
<color=black>Intake</color=black> <color=red>Red Light</color>: An intake vent will show a red signal if it is either leaking fumes or has any routes not connected to a purifier. This is not allowed in the final vent formation.
<color=green>Green Light</color>: If a vent is transporting fumes and has no leaks, a green signal will show. This is permitted and encouraged in the final vent formation.

<b>Timer:</b>
If the purifier system shows a countdown, this is the estimate of time left before local fume density raises to the point where hallucinogenic effects exceed healthy limits and can cause long term mental damage. It is strongly recommended to finalize vent formation before this timer is depleted.


<b>Multiples:</b>
Some intakes will be split to feed into two or more vents. These are powerful intakes that take in more fumes than typical and require every feed to lead to a purifier.
