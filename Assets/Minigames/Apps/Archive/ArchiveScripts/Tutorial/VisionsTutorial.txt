I've been playing around with- I mean experimenting with the Visions app on my end. I'm less doing it for money, and more doing it to gather data.

My main hope was to find a way to get more officials working on the app, but bandwidth is scarce. However, I'm not without discoveries. I've found a few strategies that might help you!

<size=35><b>Pieces:</b></size>
- If you don't know where to place a piece, just set it anywhere off <b>the piece platter</b>. A new piece will spawn and you can come back to that piece later.
<color=#AAAAAA><size=25>(Note: I don't actually know what the surface they serve us pieces on is called, so I'm just going to call it <b>the piece platter</b>. I will update the archives as I learn more.)</size></color>

- Once all pieces have been removed from <b>the piece platter</b>, it will disappear, giving you more area to work. If a constellation feels too hard, get some working space.

<size=35><b>Listening:</b></size>
- If an <b>ear</b> appears in the top left corner of your screen while <color=red>The Great Ram</color> is active, I'm signaling to you that you can keep working. He's most likely just talking, so you can feel free to eavesdrop while doing puzzles.

<size=35><b>Blessings:</b></size>
- The <b>blessings</b> they offer are insane! They can speed up your progress hundreds of times over. If things seem to be going slow, check if you can afford a blessing.

- The <b>blessings</b> button will glow if you can afford an upgrade.

- If you don't remember what your blessings do, the shop has a <b>bought</b> tab. Click that to look at your purchasing history.

<size=35><b>A Challenge:</b></size>
I'll post my fastest times in the incentives app! If you can beat all my times, I'll send you something nice!
