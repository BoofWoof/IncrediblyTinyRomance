Dear Pointless Flex Minimus,

I see you let part of the city come to ruin, but didn't have the good manners to be deposed in the process... Well, it's not the end of the world- yet.

We've unfortunately become accustomed to such disasters, whether it be sections of city being disintigrated by deific touch, people being driven to madness, or even Sozan's destroying their own homes in a panic. I've seen it all and have done my best to bring our city back from ruin. Do understand, however, your failings take time to repair, and in the meantime, everything is going to run slower. If you don't like it, try doing your job better.

P.S. If you don't like the tone, fire me. Good luck finding anyone willing to tolerate half as much as I do.
