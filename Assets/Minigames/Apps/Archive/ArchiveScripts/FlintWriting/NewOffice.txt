<i>To the PM office advertisement team from the desk of <b><color=#D3AF37>Milo</color></b>: </i>

The new and fully rebuilt office is mostly ready! Designed completely from the ground up- <b>literally</b> considering the state the building was in following the loss of our previous PM.

We settled on a design based on comments from our previous Pontifexes. <color=grey>(Pontifexi?)</color>

First and foremost, the office building itself has been heightened significantly. A total of three new floors have been added to elevate the PM closer to <color=red><b>The Great Ram</b></color>. This serves to not only reduce the noise and flashing lights complaints we've been getting about the PRAYER system, but also helps direct GOD's attention to the offices themselves <i>(and away from everything around it)</i>. We're still working on finding uses for the extra floors. Any ideas are welcome!

As for the design itself, we've taken into account how our previous PM's felt the space was <i>cramped</i>, saying how they felt <i>'doomed'</i> and <i>'trapped'</i>. So the office has been made spacious and very walkable, with the latest in tremor stabilizing tech to allow our new PM to walk around leisurely.

<b>Astoundingly</b>, we've encountered a <b>minor issue</b> when it comes to the paintings planned for the office. Somebody <i>(I won't name any names but you'll be getting called to my office soon)</i> misread my order and went and commissioned <b>several 'artists'</b> and not <b>a single artist several times</b>. As such, we have an abundance of paintings to choose from and it simply feels wasteful to not make use of them. I think it might be best to simply <b>allow the PM to pick out which paintings they want to look at</b>.

I think we have enough done of the new office to shoot some promotional material for the advertisements. The only thing missing is a vending machine so the new PM doesn't need to trudge down half the building to get a snack. We're running into an issue with that since the moving company we've employed is absolutely stonewalling us on getting the damned thing to the top floor. They keep citing some nonsense clause about <i>'not working with spiral staircases'</i> which sounds totally made up.

Either way, you're good to get some shots of the place for the advertisement. Also, don't mind the <b>empty shelves</b>. The PM will fill those up themself!
