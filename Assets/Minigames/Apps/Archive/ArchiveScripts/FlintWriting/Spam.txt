<i> The link leads to a series of sites that don't seem to ever lead to whatever product was promised and only serve to bombard our systems with more data and advertisements. At no point do we seem to ever receive the item promised. Furthermore, every new site brings a host of malevolent data that tries to squirm into our systems, opening back doors and tunnels into our servers. Further dives into the divine network will only be done with closed systems for now since we're still working on scrubbing all the invasive data from our servers.</i>
