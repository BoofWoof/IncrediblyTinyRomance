  UpgradeDescription: A tranquil soul can sense more. (Increase your cursor's vision
    range based on how calm The Great Ram is.)
  MascotDialogue: 'Hey, I''m gonna activate some new sensors quick!<n>

    Just
    to monitor your mood!<n>

    Or really, monitor the most powerful biometric
    signature to me...<n>

    But I''m sure that will be yours, right?<n>

    Either
    way, practice controlling your emotions and staying calm!<n>

    The more calm
    you are, the more bright your light will shine!'
