  MascotDialogue: 'Came back for the rest of the story did you?

    <c=Yes>I knew
    it!

    <c=Heck yeah!>Don''t get too excited!<n>

    Alright, where was I...<n>

    Oh
    right, <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color>''s final flight!<n>

    You see, him and
    his four closest students had created a ship made to travel to the edge of the
    universe, to heaven!<n>

    An accomplishment we can''t even recreate today!<n>

    And
    us mortals, trapped on this globe, only got to watch him soar, our wings too
    useless to follow such glory...<n>

    A month passed... and nothing changed.
    There was no news, and many called him a suicidal billionare.<n>

    And then...
    one of his apprentices returned. He appeared as if from nowhere, crying tears
    of joy!<n>

    He announced that <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color> had completed
    his quest, that he had arrived in heaven and he had found it... lacking...<n>

    The
    afterlife was empty, nothing but lost souls, doomed to wander an empty mass of
    void forever.<n>

    And once more, <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color> had a new
    dream, a new goal.<n>

    Him and three of his apprentices decided to stay
    behind, to build a true heaven, a paradise.<n>

    As for the one apprentice
    sent back home, he was sent to recruit more to <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color>''s
    cause! Building an afterlife is no trivial task, possibly an infinite one, one
    only possible with the leadership of our lord!<n>

    As for now, the latest
    of that line of apprentices, <color=#87F8FA>Saleos</color>, helps train us to
    be worthy of working by <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color>''s side!<n>

    And now
    for a secret!<n>

    Me and my siblings are just one of <color=#87F8FA>Saleos</color>''s
    many mouths and ears! And I''m more than happy to invite you to join us!<n>

    A
    nest is never far away... and we''d always be happy to have you!<n>

    Come
    check out the rest of our family, would you?'
