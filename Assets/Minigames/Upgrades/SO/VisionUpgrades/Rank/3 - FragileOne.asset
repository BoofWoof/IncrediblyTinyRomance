  MascotDialogue: 'Have you ever heard of <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color>, the founder
    of <color=blue>FLOCK</color>?

    <c=No>Then I have something wonderful to
    tell you!

    <c=Who is he?>I''m glad you asked!<n>

    Back before the four
    megacorps rose to prominence, a flightless bird glanced up at the sky and yearned
    to explore it.<n>

    He would see his friends, his family, and even his wife
    live his dream... but he remained firmly planted to the ground.<n>

    It was
    isolating...<n>

    Terrifying...<n>

    And yet, when he stared down in
    despair, what looked back at him were his two functioning hands.<n>

    He
    realized that, while his wings may be useless, the rest of himself was not.<n>

    Trial
    after trial, he worked to find a way to craft a way into the sky.<n>

    And
    for the longest time, his obsession left him isolated...<n>

    He didn''t
    even realize when his wife grew sick and passed...<n>

    He didn''t even realize
    when his children left him...<n>

    If he had noticed, I am sure it would
    have pained him, but his dream came first...<n>

    AND IT WAS WORTH IT! One
    day, he felt the gound leave his talons... and that ground never returned.<n>

    HE
    HAD CRAFTED THE FIRST PLANE, THROUGH SHEER DETERMINATION AND EFFORT!<n>

    And
    yet, when he returned home to boast of his accomplishment... he found the ruin
    his household had been left in... of the life he now had.<n>

    Some say that
    day broke him, but the believers know it gave him a new resolve.<n>

    Once
    more his wife was somewhere he couldn''t go, soaring in the embrace of heaven...
    and he had to follow.<n>

    He continued his work, monitizing his invention,
    investing every last dollar he had to soar even higher!<n>

    He was certain
    that the afterlife was just a bit higher, just a bit further.<n>

    His fortune
    grew, as did his work. Him and his apprentices toiled around the clock, determined
    to get to the moon...<n>

    And then further! Beyond the rays of our sun,
    beyond our galaxy, to the edges of the universe!<n>

    He sent probe after
    probe!<n>

    And on the final launch... <color=#87F8FA>Arkae</color> announced
    that he... that he would be manning the next flight...<n>

    He said this
    would be the last time his feet touched the ground. That he had discovered heaven,
    and...<n>

    Well, the rest of the story will wait for you, for when you continue
    up the rankings.<n>

    I hope to tell you more soon!'
