I don't know which is worse. Being some toy for a pathetic loser... or being you. @PengWIN
Fast food again? Do you even know how to cook or is your divine domain limited to atrocities and crying alone in your room? @PorkuPiningForLove
This prayer system is stupid and is probably just some AI training scam bullshit. @Ratical
