You crushed my car the other day... can I ask for an apology without being smote? @PrettyPlease
If god is all powerful and all good, why are you such a dick? @Alvin
Are you balding? Don't rams usually have more wool? @FancyPlants
I'm small enough to see every flaw you have. Isn't that neat? @Carrots
I have to be honest, God, the new church music sucks. Can you like... get better music. @Baathoven
I missed church service because you were creating another disaster. Does that still count as a sin even though you caused it? @WhatDoYouWant
Call me a polytheist, but we used to see a lot more gods. Now there is only one. Don't you have any friends? @OldFaith
What are those rings going into your neck? Can you get rid of them? They look painful. @Naturalist
Take a shower. We can smell your musky ass all the way down here. @NotIntoIt
You snore. Stop. @NoSleep
You ate my friends... @NotIntoIt
You're a sadistic asshole. Smite me. I don't care. @ImDone
I'm so scared. Leave us alone. I just want peace again. @Hip
I keep praying for a cool new hat. Guess what? No cool new hat. Try harder God. @FancyPlants
This whole prayer system is a joke. Everyone knows the real ones don't get to you. It's just meant to let us vent. @ShoutIt
My insurance doesn't cover acts of god? You both are evil. @BigFunds
I've seen bigger. @GoodTaste
What you the god of? RGB lit keyboards? Nice lights dork. @Huethan
Touch grass! Maybe eat it too! LmaoXD @MeatyMeat
If you're all powerful, can't you just fix the weird hook in your horn? Just saying. @BeNormal
Imagine being so insecure you need to bully something you can't even see to feel good about yourself- oh wait, you don't have to. @NotOneOfTheSheep
I could kick your ass if you were my size. @BullYou
There's compensating for something and then there's whatever you're doing. I'd say get a life but I'd rather you stopped living. @FaithIsStupid
Hey, why don't you go 'Ram' your face into a brick wall. Loser! @DeerDrover11
You must be the god of vanity lifters. @BeefcakeBear46
Small *eggplant emoji* energy. @DuckofLuck
Hey maybe refrain from eating more of our plane. You're really putting on weight and we can all see it. @ItsTrue
Do those tubes have an off switch? The glow keeps me up at nights. @RestlessReindeer
Seriously dude, get a girlfriend or at least do that in another room. @Florence.Nightengale.As.In.The.Bird
Remember when you stubbed your toe last week? I do, I got video and I'm showing everyone. Funniest shit ever. @ [username is hyperlink to the video]
Doesn't matter how many of us you crush or eat, you're still pathetic and alone. @TruthSpeakerAnteater
Trim your nose hairs. @IMadeThisAccountJustToPostThis
Heya, got any divine solutions to get sheep stink out of an apartment? My whole place reeks of sad-lonely-egomaniac and I've tried everything to get it out. @MeerkatPat
Honestly, just go ahead and crush us all at this point. Saves us the misery of having to be under your rule. @HurryUpAndDoIt
If these prayers were real you'd have died of a stroke in your sleep. @MantisPraying
It's a shame our plane isn't big enough for you to choke on. @AngeredWolfX.X
You are cruel, vile and honestly those horns just look stupid. @DudeWithBiggerHorns
If they had a 'biggest loser' contest and you competed in it you'd probably get disqualified for bumming out the other contestants. @WinnerWinnerChickenDinner
I used to work in the plane waste disposal facility until you crushed it under your thumb and it was the largest pile of garbage I'd ever seen until you showed up. @WasteED
You crushed everything I own and cared about so now I'm going to die broke and alone. We have that in common. @PublicLibraryAccess#8944
Nice power fantasy, jackass. @FoolOfAFox
I don't know which is worse. Being some toy for a pathetic loser... or being you. @PengWIN
Fast food again? Do you even know how to cook or is your divine domain limited to atrocities and jacking off alone in your room? @PorkuPiningForLove
This prayer system is stupid and is probably just some AI training scam bullshit. @Ratical
I had a lottery ticket in my apartment you swallowed that had a 12 million nanobuck jackpot on it. So you owe me 12 million nanobucks, asshole! @ WouldBeMilletionare
Please please please start brushing your teeth! It's already hard enough to hear you speak, but your breath stinks like poop from a butt! @SmellyKelly
c======3  @ AnActualArtist
I know you don't ever read this but those tubes look ridiculous. @HawKING
Hey, wool-for-brains? Could you smite my neighborhood next? Getting really tired of staring at your oversized ass all day. @NeedANewView
I did the math and I can safely say, in terms of relative inches, I'm bigger than you in more ways than one. @HungAF
You crushed my favorite boba tea place. Life now sucks even more. @TsundererDeerer
The only people who are bigger losers than you are your worshipers. @TwinklesparkThePone
Vanity muscles. @Gearaffe
Blessed are those you ate because at least they don't have to see your loser face anymore. @catificusMaximus
Hey so everything was great before you arrived, things suck now and it's your fault. @dontwannabeunderramrule
If these prayers worked you'd have shit yourself to death by now. @meeeeerCat

Whenever I'm feeling down I just look up and remember that at least I'm not a piece of shit loser like you. @TenRekt
You should go out more. Please. I can't bear seeing more of you. @PlatyPUSSCrusher
Horns aren't supposed to look like that. @AntiLope
Worship this dick. @username6969696
I'd tell you to eat my ass but your diet already sucks. @FedUpFennec
Hey, are those tubes filled with loser juice? Because you suck! @hahahah1124442
Being in your ownership is horrible but at least I'm not you. @BethJohnston89
So how many of us do you need to crush before you feel good about yourself? @Lllllllllllloyd
A prayer system? Who'd want to pray to this fucking asshole? @DolphWIN
You didn't even crush a shitty part of the city, can you do anything right? @BeMineErmine
