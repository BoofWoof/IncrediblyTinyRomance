0, Sozans!
24, The Blessed!
52, My fellow beautiful sheep-!
125, May the holy ram bless us all on this day - our most final days.
270, Were those words uncomfortable to you? 
330, 'Our most final days?'
432, One might think that the ministry sits too high up to hear the voices of the people-
590, but the ministry is the people, and we know your fears.
700, When I first learned of our fate, I felt the same way. 
820, I'm a simple canine, a mortal, just like all of you, and that means we are all flawed.
1056, Afterall, only the great ram is capable of perfection, but we can still work to carve away at our most sinful ways-
1260, to calm our fears of the unknown.
1344, When the holy city fell-
1392, back in an era when we foolishly mistook lesser gods as equal to The Holy Ram-
1570, No!
1615, No, those words are too generous for our mistake-
1704, Back in an era we sinfully thought that The Holy Ram was less than those garbed in white-
1855, Back on the day when our sins and mistakes were purged when the holy city was smote-
2010, I was on a missionary trip far from the damned, one of the few survivors of the old ministry that day...
2232, I was shaken.
2280, My old life, my mistaken faith, my sense of safety...
2424, All of them were gone...
2500, A temptation sat before me-
2568, I wanted to shut down, run from my duties-
2650, To curse the name of the very ram that had taken everything from me-!
2760, But I didn't-
2808, Because I was still alive, and I could still push forward...
2952, Those lost in the holy city were doomed in a way that we aren't.
3055, They were heathens prevented from finding redemption by an immediate end.
3160, But through their loss, a message was given, a path for us to redeem ourselves before our very end-
3360, The great ram marks our days, and asks that we spend them well.
3490, When some see the end, they are prone to destructive acts:
3579, Rioting, looting, cutting themselves off from the rest of Soza.
3685, But there is so much future to plan for still, beyond the end the Ram has chosen for us.
3864, Keep productive, keep holy, and above all else, keep determined.
4000, I know I will.
4075, I have a plan for the future.
4135, I hope you do too.
4180, -
4255, And that'll be it for Milo's Dogma, see you all tomorrow!
4330, (Bark!)
