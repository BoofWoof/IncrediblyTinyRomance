375, Do you think a dragon hides inside their caves fearing what's outside it?

1360, (Bark Notification)
1400, It's a city's name?
1450, I never heard of it... which is weird since there's only like 6 megacities...

1810, Today, we are livestreaming my life as a simple kobold, 
1880, working my silly little life away,
1940, but this podcast will document my journey into dragondom,

3080, Well, because you need to be as clever and hard working as I am to pull it off!
3170, There is no expense I won't cut and no job I won't take!
3240, I worked my way from being a literal debt slave to a figurative one,
3325, and soon I might be able to actually keep some of the money that I make!

3700, Also I need to make sure my phone doesn't go out of date so I can keep working,
3792, hope that my normal delivery routes don't get closed to make room for more cars,
3870, and make sure my loyalty points stay high enough that the KD app will pay out well for me...

4800, If most laborers are independent contractors, then there is less financial and legal strain on the dragons!
4930, They're keeping their hordes big, and it only makes me more eager to join them!
5050, (Bark Notification)
5080, Also, once again, they're not literal dragons...
5160, it's mainly just CEOs and shareholders for the four megacorps.
5245, Can't a kobold use poetic language without it being taken literally?
5335, Anyways, I just got a delivery order, so I gotta get going!
5415, I'll leave you with me putting one of my money saving tips into practice!
